Networking Architecture with Terraform

in this project, I used Terraform to create a comprehensive networking architecture within AWS. The architecture includes several key components:

1)VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): A logically isolated network for our resources.

2)Subnets: Segmented networks within the VPC to organize and isolate resources.

3)Internet Gateway: Enables communication between the VPC and the internet.

4)Route Tables: Define the traffic routing rules within the network.

5)Subnet Associations: Link subnets to the appropriate route tables to enforce routing rules.

6)Security Groups: Act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic to AWS resources.

7)EC2 Instances: Virtual servers hosted within the defined subnets.

By scripting this infrastructure with Terraform, we ensure consistent, repeatable deployments, facilitating efficient and scalable management of our AWS environment.
